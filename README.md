# Blog-Backend
This is a simple blog appp that allows users read articles, comment on articles, share articles via email, 
I made use of paginators, template inheritance, tagging system


NOTE: 
I got most of the code I used in this project from 'Django 3 by example, build powerful and reliable python webapps from scratch'
